//! This crate provides a [`TypeRegistry`] that is capable of storing and providing back information about
//! historic Substrate based types (ie those that are handed back in pre-V14 metadata). It's somewhat
//! analogous to the [`scale-info`](https://github.com/paritytech/scale-info) crate, but for legacy type
//! information rather than modern type information.
//!
//! See [`TypeRegistry::insert()`] to learn how to add types to the registry, and [`TypeRegistry::resolve_type()`]
//! to learn how to then resolve type information using the registry.
//!
//! This crate, like `scale-info`, can be used in conjunction with crates like:
//! - [`scale-decode`](https://github.com/paritytech/scale-decode) to decode SCALE encoded bytes
//!   into custom types based on this type information.
//! - [`scale-encode`](https://github.com/paritytech/scale-encode) to SCALE encode custom types
//!   into bytes based on this type information.
//! - [`scale-value`](https://github.com/paritytech/scale-value) to SCALE encode or decode from a
//!   `Value` type (a bit like `serde_json`'s `Value` type).
